Tools for detecting and correcting problems with specific Android devices.
This library is designed to help developers handle known issues and "personality" with specific android devices/builds and contains code that allows the developer to separate capability specific code from their application.

The initial code was provided by Sixgreen Labs Inc. but we encourage involvement from all android developers who have code to contribute.

This project was started as a result of a developer group thread: [Fragmentation-resistant product design](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/android-developers/yC39Z4v-oFs/discussion)
